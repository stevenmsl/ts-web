composition vs inheritance

- composition
  - delegate the work
    - Model delegates the work of events handling,
      synchronization, and holding data to child 
      components. #CI01
    - expose the functionality of the child 
      components through getter to the outside
      world. #CI02  
    - define the interface that child
      components need to implement so 
      later you can swap out them easily #CI03

- inheritance
  - you don't want to repeat the work of defining
    the getters to expose the functionality of
    the child components #CI04
  - define static methods that will wire up
    the child components and return a new
    instance of a specific model class #CI05
